This is just part of the project since the whole thing is 1 GB large.
Especially the data. In each folder I only take several samples, sometimes
out of hundreds or thousands of images.
A lot of code files and data are obsolete, but I put it here just to show 
the things that I have tried.
Computer side need Keras and OpenCV installed.
Raspberry Pi side need OpenCV installed.

Most important files in Computer folder:
+tkClient0.py (main)
+SupFunctions (folder containing support functions for main)
+noisyLanesNet0.hdf5 (model for steering)
+signNet1.hdf5 (model for sign recognition)
